# 南哪印象

由贝塔软件制作

### 引入介绍

你是否是一位南京大学的大学生或者研究生，甚至博士生？如果是，你是否走遍过整个校园，清楚许多设施的主要功能和附属功能，体验过这些功能能为你的生活带来的改变？

你是否是一位其他高校的学生，想走出去看一看另外一所大学的生活？

你是否是一位高中生甚至初中生，正在考虑自己的未来，想去博览众多大学的模样？

就算你并不满足上述所有的情况，你是否在听到别人提起南京大学或者“九乡河文理学院”时，如标题一般提问：南哪大学？抑或是仅限于知道这所南京大学的存在？

但这都没有关系，不管是受限于疫情没有办法踏足这所大学的土地，还是苦于没有同伴陪同走遍整所校园，甚至是想要体验一些不一样的生活，你都能在这款娱乐性应用中找到（当然如果愿意你也可以称之为游戏）

这个项目应用3D建模技术，在平衡时间期限的前提下尽可能为你还原了南京大学仙林校区的风景与建筑；借助unity3d引擎的帮助，能让你在这所构建于你掌心之上的高校中畅游；利用在一定时间内构思的剧情和小游戏，为你呈现丰富多彩的校园生活；与此同时，精美制作的UI交互界面和人物立绘也将带给你良好的使用体验

### 仓库介绍

由于github仓库上传容量和上传速度限制，本仓库仅仅托管了游戏中自制的建筑模型和部分UI界面素材，并且这些模型和素材都是开源的，以方便其他开发者的使用或优化，项目本身请移步Unity的项目托管平台PlasticSCM

此外由于项目时间限制，许多制作细节不够精美，也许在将来进一步维护时优化……

### Introduction to the Project

Are you a college student or graduate student or even a doctoral student in Nanjing University? If yes, have you traveled all over the campus, understood the main functions and auxiliary functions of many facilities, and experienced the changes that these functions can bring to your life?

Are you a student of another university who wants to go out and have a look at the life of another university?

Are you a high school student or even a junior high school student who is thinking about your future and wants to see the appearance of many universities?

Even if you are not satisfied with all the above situations, have you ever heard someone mention Nanjing University or "jiuxianghe College of Arts and Sciences" and ask the following questions like the title: which university? Or is it limited to knowing the existence of Nanjing University?

But it doesn't matter. You can find it in this entertainment application (of course, you can also call it a game if you like) whether you are unable to set foot in the land of this university due to the epidemic situation, or suffer from traveling around the whole campus without companions, or even want to experience some different life

This project applies 3D modeling technology to restore the landscape and architecture of Xianlin Campus of Nanjing University as much as possible on the premise of balancing the time limit; With the help of unity3d engine, you can swim in this university built on your palm; Use the plot and games conceived in a certain period of time to present you with a rich and colorful campus life; At the same time, the beautifully made UI interactive interface and character drawing will also bring you a good use experience

### Introduction to the Repository

Due to the limitation of the uploading capacity and speed of the GitHub warehouse, this warehouse only hosts the self-made building models and  part of UI interface materials in the game, and these models and materials are open source to facilitate the use or optimization of other developers. Please move to the project hosting platform plasticscm of unity for the project itself

And due to the time limit for the project, a lot of details are not presented delicatedly, we may beautify them when maintaining this project afterwards...
